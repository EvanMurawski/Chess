test:
add more test cases
test cases for obvious moves


engine:

option for more verbose logging (include evaluation)
handle exit command
handle other commands
Canceled: use selected node as new root node: don't rebuild, no time savings

alphabetanew:
options for more verbose logging
find whose move it is from node instead of function argument
Save the score in the nodes
Return the final alpha beta score value of the selected node to analyzesignleposition.py so it can show that value
insted of just the heuristic value of that node

Node:
clean up

castling
en passant
add piece factors for other pieces

other:
debug what happened at the end of my game
Clearly differentiate between heuristic scores and eval scores (return value of alpha bet afunction
